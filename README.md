# Knight's Travails
Project created as part of the Odin Project [Curiculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/knights-travails) to practice with searching.

The program takes a start position and a target position on an 8 x 8 chessboard and shows what the quickest route is from the start position to the target position.
